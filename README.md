```

## Requirements Abided By

* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

* No more than 5 functions per file
* All your header files should be include guarded
* Use system calls only when you need to (why?)
* Write a README with the description of your project

## Our Shell's Capabilities

<code>This shell could work in interactive mode</code>
bash``` 
$ ./hsh

hsh shell_main.c shell.h
(~$)
(~$) exit
$ 
```
<code>And Also in Non-Interactive Mode</code>
bash```
$ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
$
$ cat test_ls_2
/bin/ls
/bin/ls
$
$ cat test_ls_2 | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
$
```
