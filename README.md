      💻  THE SIMPLE_SHELL PROJECT 💻

      💥💥💥IN THIS PROJECT WE ASSIGNED TO CREATE A BASH SHELL 💥💥💥

      THIS SHELL SHOULD✅✅✅
      # Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command. A command line always ends with a new line.
      # The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed.
      # The command lines are simple, no semicolons, no pipes, no redirections or any other advanced features.
      # The command lines are made only of one word. No arguments will be passed to programs.
      # If an executable cannot be found, print an error message and display the prompt again.
      # Handle errors.
      #You have to handle the “end of file” condition (Ctrl+D)

      THIS SHELL DOES NOT❌❌❌
      #use the PATH
      #andle special characters : ", ', `, \, *, &, #
      #be able to move the cursor
